## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple directories, each serving a specific purpose. This modular structure improves maintainability and scalability

## State Management

The application uses the Context API for state management, allowing for a centralized and efficient way to manage global states such as the section system.

So whenever we want to explore this app, you can explore using the sidebar system.

- **_A future improvment_**: an improvement for the future would be getting the initial fetch of data to avoid extra callings for the api, so in the context of the app, make a builtin data to get the movies and tv shows, at least for the home section sliders. It currently fetches every time you open the home section.

## Future Improvements

Based on the project due date, there are some features that needed work, and some extra steps to ensure a better handling of the web components and overall security best practices:

- Search Section: due to the due date, I couldn't fully implement the search engine with the API, but this was meant to be built based on the movie and tv show section, so you do a search, fetch data from the api, and be able to load more data, based on the page number.
- Enhanced Search: Add a more advanced search functionality with filters based on score average, release date, and relevant data.
- Authentication: Implement user authentication and allow users to save favorite movies and tv shows.
- Pagination: Implement pagination for better performance with large datasets.
- Improved Detail section: Another thing that could be a great improvement in the detail section when clicking the media cards would be adding more details from a tag system for genres, actors, directors, production companies, and overall be able to deploy more information to the user for a more well rounded user experience.
- Environment Variables: this project was made without the use of environment variables to make a prototype, so most of the bearer data for the TMDB API, data that we don't want to be available, is currently public. A future improvement is to make all that data into private environment variables to be handled when deploying the app
- Services and Improvements in Context API: as a prototype this project handles fetching data is built inside each component, so an obvious improvement would be to handle all fetching in one session, with a context api built towards handling all data from both movies and series in the beginning for the `HomeSection`, so we avoid extra load outs.

## PART 2 TEST ASSESSMENT - ARCHITECTURE

### Scaling State Management

1. Transition to Redux: While the Context API is suitable for managing state in smaller applications, transitioning to Redux would provide better scalability and performance as the application grows. Redux facilitates centralized state management, making it easier to manage complex states across multiple components.

2. Normalized State: Normalize the application state to avoid redundancy and improve data consistency. This involves structuring the state shape in a flat, normalized form, which simplifies updates and reduces the risk of inconsistencies.

### Component Structure

1. Component Decomposition: Break down larger components into smaller, reusable ones to promote code reusability and maintainability. Adopting a component-based architecture ensures that components are modular and independent, facilitating easier maintenance and updates.

2. Optimized Rendering: Implement memoization techniques such as React.memo and useMemo to optimize rendering performance. By memoizing components and memoizing expensive computations, unnecessary re-renders can be minimized, improving overall performance.

### Backend Integration

Scalable Backend Architecture: Ensure the backend architecture is designed to handle increased traffic and data volume as the application scales. Utilize scalable cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud Platform to deploy and manage backend infrastructure, enabling seamless scalability and reliability.

### Routing and Navigation

- Advanced Routing: Upgrade the routing system to support more advanced features such as nested routes, code splitting, and prefetching. Libraries like React Router or Next.js provide advanced routing capabilities that enhance navigation and improve user experience.
- Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading to dynamically load components and resources as needed, reducing initial page load time and improving performance. Lazy loading can be applied to route-based code splitting and component loading, optimizing resource utilization.

### Cloud Services and Deployment

1. Automated Deployment: Implement automated deployment pipelines using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions to streamline the deployment process and ensure consistency across environments. Automated deployments reduce manual errors and improve deployment efficiency.

2. Scalable Hosting: Choose a hosting provider that offers scalable infrastructure and autoscaling capabilities to handle fluctuations in traffic and demand. Platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Azure App Service provide scalable hosting solutions that can automatically adjust resources based on workload.

By implementing these architectural considerations, the application can effectively scale to accommodate a larger user base and handle increased complexity while maintaining performance, reliability, and maintainability
